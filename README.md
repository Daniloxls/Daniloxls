Currently, I develop APIs and applications using **Go**, **AWS**, **React**, and **React Native**, while continuing to explore new technologies that improve performance, maintainability, and user experience.

I’m also a **Computer Science bachelor at UFCA**, where I’ve combined my academic journey with real-world projects in **software architecture**, **educational game development**, and **cloud-based backend systems**.
